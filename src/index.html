            <h4> Nasal consumption benefits</h4>


            
            <p>  Nasal decongestants are useful medications for the common cold and for allergic rhinitis with congestion. They are safe for most patients, but their labeling includes a host of precautions. Failure to follow the label can increase the risk of adverse reactions in users. It is vital for pharmacists to consult with patients about these powerful pharmacological medications. Pharmacists must also be aware of the abuse of these products. Nasal decongestants include the oral decongestant pseudoephedrine (e.g., Sudafed), as well as topical sprays (e.g., Afrin, Neo-Synephrine) and inhalers (e.g., Benzedrex). It should be noted that this column does not address prescription products such as steroidal sprays (e.g., Rhinocort, Flonase). These products have their own set of adverse reactions.</p>
